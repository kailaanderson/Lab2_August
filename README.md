# Lab2_August
In this lab, I demonstrate my knowledge of switch statements in c++ by prompting the user to enter a date in August and outputting the date in a string of characters. 

Once the user inputs an integer, the int is split into a tens value and a ones value. The tens value is analyzed first, followed by the ones value.
